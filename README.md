## NOBX-Upwelling
The Northern Outer Banks (NOBX) coastal upwelling project is a hobby project monitoring the connection between upwelling indices and coastal upwelling using historical and near real-time in-situ and reanalysis data from along the northern OBX of NC.  The analysis in these scripts uses [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) and OPeNDAP to access NetCDF files.

The data used:
1. Buoy data from the National Data Buoy Center ([NDCP](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/)) via their [Thredds server.](https://dods.ndbc.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog/data/stdmet/catalog.html)
2. ERA5 via the Asia-Pacific Data-Research Center ([APDRC](http://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/)) [here.](http://apdrc.soest.hawaii.edu/dods/public_data/Reanalysis_Data/ERA5)
